Topic :
In the ever changing world of online shopping, product categorization accuracy is becoming more and more crucial. Customers will be more satisfied and have greater conversion rates if they can quickly search for and locate the products they want thanks to an automatic tagging system that works well. But one of the biggest problems in creating such systems is the noisy data present, where objects maybe incorrectly identified for a number of reasons, including mislabeling or unclear labeling made during data collection.
To tackle this issue, Clothing1M, a dataset with 1 million photos of clothing items in 14 classes, offers us the special chance and opportunity. The dataset contains a very broad range of apparel kinds, which includes shirts, t-shirts, slacks, and sweaters. It was gathered from multiple online shopping sites which will also lead to diversity in the data.
But because of how the data was gathered, a large percentage of the labels are noisyâ€”that is, inaccurate or inconsistent. Even with the inclusion of multiple smaller, well-labeled subsets of 50k, 14k, and 10k photos for training, validation, and testing, respectively, Clothing1M yet presents a major obstacle to reaching high accuracy in clothing classification systems due to the noisy labels.
Because the Clothing1M dataset closely reflects real-world data seen in e-commerce environments, where a diversity of sources and volume of data frequently result in mislabeled or unclear entries, we have opted to work with it. Misclassification can have detrimental effects on an online shopping platform, such as decreasing a product's discoverability, ineffective inventory management, and irritating customers.
Our primary aim is to make a positive impact on the e-commerce industry by enhancing and refining this dataset and building on top of it to make it more dependable and expandable for automated clothes classification.
We will use the Clothing1M dataset and a methodical technique of label correction and noise reduction. We will start by figuring out where noise frequently lies and creating plans to weed out false positives using algorithmic methods as well as the clean-labeled data sets. To decrease the influence of noisy labels, strategies such label correction algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and noise-robust models will be investigated. In order to make sure that our system maintains high classification accuracy while well generalizing to real-world data, we also employ the clean data for validation as part of the preprocessing.
   
In addition to improving clothes tagging systems' dependability, this project will be a useful case study for handling noisy, large-scale e-commerce datasets. The main objective of our work is to create a more resilient, scalable, and flexible system that can accurately categorize clothing items automatically by resolving the labeling errors, and then classifying the future test cases not present in the Clothing1M dataset. This model would have the ability to influence e-commerce and help consumers as well as businesses. It would be accurate and give appropriate product recommendations and search results.
To Summarize, our work will be a big step toward developing more intelligent and noise-tolerant AI systems for the dynamic world of online shopping.
