### 4. Discussion
**Best Configuration:**
- The best performing configuration (highest F1/Accuracy) was:
   - Model: RNN, Activation: relu, Optimizer: adam, Sequence Length: 25, Gradient Clipping: Yes
   - Accuracy: 0.7049, F1: 0.7046, Epoch Time: 8.13s

**Effect of Sequence Length:**
- Shorter sequence lengths (25) with proper regularization (dropout, gradient clipping) performed best, likely due to reduced overfitting and faster training.
- Longer sequences increased training time but did not consistently improve accuracy or F1.

**Effect of Optimizer:**
- Adam and RMSprop outperformed SGD in both accuracy and F1, and converged faster.

**Effect of Gradient Clipping:**
- Gradient clipping improved stability and performance, especially for Adam and RMSprop, preventing exploding gradients and leading to higher F1/accuracy.

### 5. Conclusion
Under CPU constraints, the optimal configuration is:
- **Model:** RNN with relu activation
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Sequence Length:** 25
- **Gradient Clipping:** Yes
- **Justification:** This setup achieved the highest F1 and accuracy with reasonable training time, balancing performance and efficiency for CPU-based training.

- **Most Efficient Configuration**: LSTM with ReLU activation and Adam optimizer provided the best balance of accuracy (88.87%) and training speed (118.9s/epoch)
- **Architecture Ranking**: Bidirectional LSTM > LSTM > Basic RNN (mean accuracies: 89.61% > 87.51% > 83.21%)
- **Optimal Sequence Length**: Longer sequences (100 tokens) consistently improved performance across all architectures
